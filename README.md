This library will help you check [JWT](https://jwt.io/) payload

> This library doesn't validate the token, any well formed JWT can be decoded from Base64Url.

## Installation

#### Cocoapods

If you are using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org), add this line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'JWTDecode', '~> 2.6'
```

Then run `pod install`.

> For more information on Cocoapods, check [their official documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

#### Carthage

If you are using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "auth0/JWTDecode.swift" ~> 2.6
```

Then run `carthage bootstrap --use-xcframeworks`.

> For more information about Carthage usage, check [their official documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).

#### SPM

If you are using the Swift Package Manager, open the following menu item in Xcode:

**File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...**

In the **Choose Package Repository** prompt add this url: 

```
https://github.com/auth0/JWTDecode.swift.git
```

Then press **Next** and complete the remaining steps.

> For further reference on SPM, check [its official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

## Usage

Import the framework

```swift
import JWTDecode
```

Decode the token

```swift
let jwt = try decode(jwt: token)    
```

### JWT Parts

#### Header dictionary

```swift
jwt.header
```

#### Claims in token body

```swift
jwt.body
```

#### Token signature

```swift
jwt.signature
```

### Registered Claims

* "aud" (Audience)
```swift
jwt.audience
```
* "sub" (Subject)
```swift
jwt.subject
```
* "jti" (JWT ID)
```swift
jwt.identifier
```
* "iss" (Issuer)
```swift
jwt.issuer
```
* "nbf" (Not Before)
```swift
jwt.notBefore
```
* "iat" (Issued At)
```swift
jwt.issuedAt
```
* "exp" (Expiration Time)
```swift
jwt.expiresAt
```

### Custom Claims

If we also have our custom claims we can retrive them calling `claim(name: String) -> Claim` then you can try converting the value like:

```swift
let claim = jwt.claim(name: "email")
if let email = claim.string {
    print("Email in jwt was \(email)")
}
```

The supported conversions are:

```swift
var string: String?
var boolean: Bool?
var integer: Int?
var double: Double?
var date: NSDate?
var array: [String]?
```

You can easily add a convenience accessor for a custom claim by adding an extension:

```swift
extension JWT {
    var myClaim: String? {
        return claim(name: "my_claim").string
    }
}
```

### Error Handling

If the token is invalid an `NSError` will be thrown from the `decode(token)` function:

```swift
catch let error as NSError {
    error.localizedDescription
}
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).
